# Jesse Xie, Qina Liu, Patrick Ging

# SUMMARY OF TRIO DISCUSSION
# I did not have my trio's work b/c of my lack of github knowledge, Jessie explained to me some basic functions of github, which was vv kind of him
# Patrick's trios used github API, which is too complex than needed
# Jessie's trios code could be simplified, did not need a method when one line could make it more concise
# DISCOVERIES
# How to make a folder and file in github; what commiting, pushing, and pulling is (learned from Jessie and Google)
# QUESTIONS
# If our python knowledge is subpar, are we to make up for it/ catch up on our own using online resources?
# COMMENTS
# No additional comments
