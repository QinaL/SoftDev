        <h1>Get Your Foundation Features Here!</h1>
        <h3>Control the X-Grid!</h3>
        <div class="grid-x">
            <div class="cell small-4 medium-2 large-5" style="background-color: blue;">
                 Cell 1
             </div>
            <div class="cell small-4 medium-5 large-5" style="background-color: purple;">
                 Cell 2
             </div>
             <div class="cell small-4 medium-5 large-2" style="background-color: pink;">
                 Cell 3
             </div>
           </div>
        Each cell is given a different color to illustrate its boundaries. 
        <br><br>
        <h3>Change Screen Size!</h3>
        Foundation allows you easier change how the site looks depending on the size of the screen: small-sized screen, medium-sized screen, or large-sized screen. 
        <br><br>
        <p style="font-style: italic;"> Try it Yourself! Change your screen size </p>
        You will see that on a small screen, all 3 cells are equally sized, while on the medium screen, the Cell 1 becomes the smaller than the other 2, and on the large screen, Cell 3 becomes the smallest. Cool, right?
        <br><br>
        <h3>Control the Y-Grid!</h3>
        The same can be done vertically!
         <div class="grid-y" style="height:400px">
            <div class="cell small-4 medium-2 large-5" style="background-color: blue;">
                 Cell 1
             </div>
            <div class="cell small-4 medium-5 large-5" style="background-color: purple;">
                 Cell 2
             </div>
             <div class="cell small-4 medium-5 large-2" style="background-color: pink;">
                 Cell 3
             </div>
           </div>
        <br><br>
        <p style="font-weight: bold;"> WOW! VERY COOL!</p>
        <br><br>
        <h3>Padding</h3>
        Give marigins around your text, so it looks nicer!
        <div class="grid-x grid-padding-x grid-padding-y">
            <div class="cell small-6 medium-2 large-7" style="background-color: lightblue;">
                 Yes, that is a hornpipe in my pocket and I am happy to see you.  Ya know, darlin’, I’m 97 percent chum free C’mon, lad, shiver me timbers! Give me freedom or give me the rope. For I shall not take the shackles that subjugate the poor to uphold the rich. Drink up me hearties yoho …a pirates life for me you know, thats the 2nd time I’v watched that man sail away with my ship. Merchant and pirate were for a long period one and the same person. Even today mercantile morality is really nothing but a refinement of piratical morality. “I’ve got a jar of dirt! I’ve got a jar of dirt, and guess what’s inside it?” “Why is the rum always gone?” How much does the pirate pay for an ear piercing? … A buccaneer! (buck- in- ear…) Right from the Voyage og Noah, surviving was by sailing. Avast ye! and sail against the tides.
