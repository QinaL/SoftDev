///temp how-to for now, will be imported to README and reshaped to be neater later

1. Make the Droplet 
- Great guides on making a 20.04 droplet:
    - https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-set-up-an-ubuntu-20-04-server-on-a-digitalocean-droplet
    - tldr press create then droplet then use the cheapest option, dont add any add ons, use ssh key that is on your system, use the closest server to us
- Options to Pick
    - Choose Ubuntu 20.04 (LTS) for this class
    - Choose the Basic (shared CPU plan)
    - Pick Regular Intel and $5/mo
    - Choose a datacenter in New York
    - Use SSH keys for authentication (see SSH Side-Route if trouble)
    - We don't want to enable backups ($1/mo), our code will be stored on GitHub
    - It is conventional to name servers in all lowercase

SSH Side-Route
    - make sure you have a ssh key on your digital ocean account (Account --> Setting --> Security)
    - "Your ( same set of) SSH keys can be used to authenticate you at multiple places. It's like your ID..."
    - Good guide on getting SSH keys back: https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/checking-for-existing-ssh-keys
    - after checking for existing keys, run $ cat ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub (or the appropriate matching key name) and copy-paste into digital ocean account

2. Access droplet 
- if you want to access the droplet via a terminal, ssh as root to your ipv4 address and say yes for the fingerprint and you should be in
- $ ssh root@<ipv4 address>
    - ex: $ ssh root@159.65.236.192
