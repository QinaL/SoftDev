k08- Virtual Environment Exploration
2021-09-30

$ python3 -m venv ~/myherozero
- creates a virtual environment
- A virtual environment is "a directory tree which contains Python executable files and other files which indicate that it is a virtual environment." (https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html)
- It keeps libaries, scripts, interpreter, dependencies isolated from other of such in other virtual environment and your computer system
- This is apparently "one of the most important tools that most of the Python developers use" (https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/python-virtual-environment/) 
- If you have a project using version 1, and another using version 2, you can use a virtual environment to access and use both projects at the same time. 

Questions
- What are scripts?

Comments
- Still not too sure of virtual environments and their usage; research is limited due to time constraint 

Concerns
- Will this topic be covered in more depth in class?
