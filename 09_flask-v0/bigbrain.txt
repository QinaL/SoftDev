k09- Flask and app.py questions
2021-10-01

Before running flask:
Q0: I only know Java. This looks vaguely familiar but not really.
Q1: The main point of reference I have is that / is used to illustrate pathways.
Q2: This will print to command terminal (?). It will print __name__ (idk what __name__ is)
Q3: This will not appear anywhere because it is a return for the function hello_world, but the code never prints out this return.
Q4: The only other language I know is Java, and Java has similar syntax to this that it uses to call methods.

After running flask:

Qina's experience:
- At first, I was getting an error: WARNING: This is a development server. Do not use it in a production deployment. Use a production WSGI server instead.
    - Running the shell command export FLASK_ENV=development changed the environment to production, and I no longer got the error 
        - info from https://pythonbasics.org/flask-environment-production/
- 

To Andy: Add your thoughts to the questions/fill in my gaps of knowledge. I no longer got an error, but nothing was printed, so idk what app.py did, add anything that you find. I'll check your github and then copy paste what u added.
