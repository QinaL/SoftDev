We noticed that the requests would default to a 'get' request if we didnt' specify.

If we passed it a list of request types, ie: ['get', 'post'], it would be able to handle both, so we had it so that it would handle both. 

We could also speficify the type of request to perform in the html form. 

Something strange was that to access the data depending on the get and post was different. For example request.form.get(property) for post and for get request.args.get(property).
