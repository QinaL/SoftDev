Video Notes 

Concerns
- when data dictates app development --> denormalize, restructure --> preformance drops 

MongoDB
- allows for multiple designs
- designed for usage patterns
- evo easy 

Method 
- evaluate app workload (size, operations)--> 
- map out entities + rltions (CRD, link or embed?)--> 
- finalize data model for each collection 

Linked vs Embed
- rltion: 1-1, 1-many, many-many
- 1-many: array in parent, scalar in child
- many-many: arrays on both side

Use
- if queries by article, embed all
- if queries by articles + users, embed + link

Bucket Pattern
- small, related data (ex: bank transactions)
- small index size
- high speed of retrieval 

Computed Pattern 
- never recompute what you can recompute 
- reads more common than write
- caching patterns

Can mix and match patterns!
